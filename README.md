TheFallen is my personal 2D mobile game project.

TheFallen is my personal 2D Vertical jump based mobile game project. All codes and most of the assets are made by me. I didn't finish this project because of certain thing, i can't make soundtracks. Except this problem all of the core gameplay mechanics and some of the enemies, collectibles, npcs, save system, sound control system, adversiment system , user interfaces, menus and some levels are completed. Also saved as prefabs and reusable. So adding new levels, enemies etc. takes shorter time.
